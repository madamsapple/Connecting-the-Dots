Final Project

By web scraping information on AI and applying an associative learning mechanism to it, a bot tries to learn about itself. This will be shown as a visualisation on a website using WebGL/three.js/D3.js.
 
This idea was inspired after seeing how AI can enhance itself by seeking inspiration from learning mechanisms in infants. Human infants are the best learners in the universe - curious, self-motivated, and able to learn unsupervised from much smaller, uncurated data. Research has already shown early success in using neural network approaches to emulate word-learning in infants. Many approaches are based on an important principle called associative learning, where knowledge is built by creating associations between words and their referring images or concepts. 
 
In order to explore the strength of this approach, I built a bot that scrapes titles of scholarly literature on AI and uses the same associative learning method to try and understand itself from the collected information. This learning process is illustrated in a visualisation. Words with similar representations are linked, demonstrating the bot's pursuit to find familiarity and meaning amidst a surrounding world of information - just like a baby.
